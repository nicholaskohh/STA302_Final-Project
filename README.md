# STA302 Final Project â€“ Airbnb Price Analysis

This project looked into how various factors such as room type, location, availability, and host portfolio size affect Airbnb nightly prices in New York City.

## Files
- `STA302 Final Project(1).Rmd`: R Markdown file with data cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
- `STA302_Final_Project_Report.pdf`: Final PDF report summarizing the findings.

## Summary
Using the NYC Airbnb Open Data, we built a linear regression model and found that **location and room type** are the most significant predictors of price. **Host portfolio size**, surprisingly, had little to no effect after controlling for other variables.

## Tools
- R
- `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `readr`, `broom`

## How to Reproduce
Open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio and knit it to PDF or HTML to regenerate the report.
